## Raspberium API Service

### Built with Django Rest Framework!

- Supports an IR Remote based light controller!
- Supports custom relays!
- Utilizes a BME280 to measure temperature, humidity, and pressure! Wow!

### Development Notes:

- Uses Docker to provision a container with the [resin.io Raspbian image](https://hub.docker.com/r/resin/raspberrypi3-python/) for local development.
- "Production" deployment is TBD!
